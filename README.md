Remember you must have a python install to your Pc or android

- now once it finish you can type this command to install the needed

```php
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

then once it done go to my main.py and change the url base on what do you want your qrcode go or will redirect

```php
data = "https://<your url>"
```

now once it finish just type this command to run.

```php
python main.py
```
